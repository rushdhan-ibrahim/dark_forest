# The Dark Forest: A Deep Inquiry

An interactive multimedia essay exploring the Dark Forest Theory from game theory and international relations.

## Overview

This is not an essay with decorations—it is a **philosophical instrument**. Through interactive visualizations, generative audio, and carefully structured arguments, readers experience the weight of cosmic silence and the trap of game-theoretic reasoning.

- **Forest Eyes**: Mouse-tracking eyes that observe you from the void
- **Glass Forest**: Civilization network visualization with chain reaction dynamics
- **Generative Soundscape**: Web Audio API synthesis that responds to scroll position
- **Interactive Elements**: Signal propagation, transmission chains, and more
